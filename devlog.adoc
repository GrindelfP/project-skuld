Maybe a https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19756[KAN] architecture will be more useful for the function approximation. Hope KAN be integrated!!!

Devlogs are now here, the https://github.com/GrindelfP/project-skuld/blob/main/README.adoc[README] should contain clean information on the project.

=== Earlier in February 2025 ===

- Tried using the task for the 1d integration - good accuracy achieved.
- Tried using the task for the 2d integration - not so good.
  
== Before February 2025 ==

- Creatred implementation for 1d integrals using PyTorch library for the neural network model.
- Created a jupyter-notebook https://github.com/GrindelfP/nni-tutorial/tree/main[tutorial] on neural network integration of a 1d functions.
